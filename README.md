# BGPhijack detection in measurements given by RIPE Atlas project


Hijacking detection has become important as more
and more Internet BGP hijacking incidents was reported. During the project, a simple yet effective BGP hijacking detection method is
proposed which based on the Round trip time (RTT), Time to live
(TTL) value and route change in the response messages from the
target to the monitors. This detection method is based on an
observation that when BGP hijacking occurs, there will be
changes in the route, RTT and TTL values. By identifying the
difference values between consecutive time slots in the same
monitor, these changes will be figured out.
